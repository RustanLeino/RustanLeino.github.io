<p>Here are some mathematical puzzles that 
I (Rustan Leino) have enjoyed.&nbsp; Most of them 
are of the kind that you can discuss and solve at a dinner table, usually 
without pen and paper.&nbsp; So as not to spoil your fun, no solutions are given 
on this page, but for some problems I have provided some hints. </p>

<h2><a name="Half the area of an L"></a>Half the area of an L</h2>
<!-- added Oct 2014 -->
<p><img alt="new Oct 2014" height="19" src="images/new.gif" width="28">[I was
asked this puzzle by Vlad Rusu, who in turn heard it from Grigore Rosu and family]</p>
<p>Two arbitrary rectangles are placed to form an "L".&nbsp; That is, the lower left-hand corner
of the two rectangles share the same point.  (What I'm trying to say is that there's an
"L" whose "I" and "_" parts have arbitrary widths and heights.)  Using only a (pen and a)
straightedge (that is, no measuring device and no compass), figure out a way to, with a
single straight cut, divide the "L" into two pieces of equal area. </p>

<h2><a name="A game of 2014 cards"></a>A game of 2014 cards</h2>
<!-- heard Jan 2014, added Oct 2014 -->
<p><img alt="new Oct 2014" height="19" src="images/new.gif" width="28">[I got this
problem from Radu Grigore, who I think told me it was a problem used in the 2009 Math
Olympics.  I suppose perhaps the problem then involved 2009 cards.]</p>
<p>There is a table with a row of 2014 cards.&nbsp; Each card has a red side and 
a blue side.&nbsp; We'll say that a card is red if the color on its visible face 
is red, and analogously for blue.&nbsp; Two players take turns to do the 
following move:&nbsp; select any 50 consecutive cards where the left-most card 
is red, then flip each of those 50 cards (thus, for those 50 cards, turning red 
cards into blue cards and blue cards into red cards).&nbsp; Both players look at 
the cards from the same side of the table, so &quot;left-most&quot; means the same to both 
of the players (that is, you can think of one of the ends of the table as being 
designated as the left end).&nbsp; When it is a player's turn, if that player 
cannot make a move (that is, if there is no way to select 50 consecutive cards 
the left-most one of which is red), then that player loses and the other player 
wins.&nbsp; If you are one of the players and all cards are initially red, can 
you be sure to win, and if so, do you want to be the player who goes first or 
second?</p>

<h2><a name="Evaluating a polynomial"></a>Evaluating a polynomial</h2>
<!-- heard Jan 2014, added Oct 2014 -->
<p><img alt="new Oct 2014" height="19" src="images/new.gif" width="28">[Prakash Panangaden
told me this problem]</p>
<p>There is a polynomial and you have access to a function that evaluates that 
polynomial at a given number.&nbsp; You don't know the degree of the polynomial, 
nor do you know any of the coefficients of its terms.&nbsp; However, you are 
told that all coefficients are non-negative integers.&nbsp; How many times do 
you need to call the evaluation function in order to identify the polynomial 
(that is, to figure out the values of its coefficients)?</p>

<h2><a name="Picking the larger of two cards"></a>Picking the larger of two cards</h2>
<!-- added Sep 2012 -->
<p><img alt="new Sep 2012" height="19" src="images/new.gif" width="28">[Roger 
Wattenhofer told me this puzzle]</p>
<p>Someone picks, at their will, two cards from a deck of cards. The cards have 
different numbers, so one is higher than the other. (In other words, the person 
picks two distinct numbers in the inclusive range 1 through 13.)&nbsp; The cards 
are placed face down on a table in front of you.&nbsp; You get to choose one of 
the cards and turn it face up.&nbsp; Now, you will select one of the two cards 
(one of whose face you can see, the other one you can't).&nbsp; If you select 
the highest card, you win.&nbsp; Design a card-selection strategy for which your 
chance of winning is strictly greater than 50%. </p>

<h2><a name="Enclosing land by fence pieces"></a>Enclosing land by fence pieces</h2>
<!-- received September 2011, added October 2011 -->
<p>[I got this puzzle from Serdar Tasiran.]</p>
<p>You are given one 44-meter piece of fence and 48 one-meter pieces of fence.&nbsp; 
Assume each piece is a straight and unbendable.&nbsp; What is the large area of 
(flat) land that you can enclose using these fence pieces?</p>

<h2><a name="Planar configuration of straight connecting lines"></a>Planar configuration of straight connecting lines</h2>
<!-- added September 2011 -->
<p>[Radu Grigore told me this problem.&nbsp; I think may have heard it 20 years earlier from Jan van de Snepscheut.]</p>
<p>Given an even number of points in general positions on the plane (that is, no 
three points co-linear), can you partition the points into pairs and connect the 
two points of each pair with a single straight line such that the straight lines 
do not overlap?</p>

<h2><a name="Reducing nearby enemies"></a>Reducing nearby enemies</h2>
<!-- received July 2011, added September 2011 -->
<p>[I got this puzzle from Jason Koenig.]</p>
<p>You are given an irreflexive symmetric (but not necessarily transitive) 
&quot;enemies&quot; relation on a set of people.&nbsp; In other words, if person A is an 
enemy of a person B, then B is also an enemy of A.&nbsp; How can you divide up 
the people into two houses in such a way that every person has at least as many 
enemies in the other house as in their own house?</p>
<p>[Hint: As Radu Grigore pointed out to me, solving the
<a href="#Planar configuration of straight connecting lines">Planar 
configuration of straight connecting lines</a> puzzle may provide a hint to
solving this puzzle.]</p>

<h2><a name="Transporting bananas"></a>Transporting bananas</h2>
<!-- received August 2011, added September 2011 -->
<p>[Rupak Majumdar told me this intriguing puzzle.]</p>
<p>You have 3000 bananas that you want to transport a distance of 1000 km.&nbsp; 
The transport will be done by a monkey.&nbsp; The monkey can carry as many as 1000 bananas
at any one time.&nbsp; With each kilometer traveled (forward or backward), the money
consumes 1 banana.&nbsp; How many bananas can you get across to the other side?</p>

<h2><a name="Car and key hide-and-seek"></a>Car and key hide-and-seek</h2>
<!-- received August 2011, added September 2011 -->
<p>[A puzzle Aistis Simaitis gave me inspired this puzzle.]</p>
<p>In a room are three boxes that on the outside look identical.&nbsp; One of 
the boxes contains a car, one contains a key, and one contains nothing.&nbsp; 
You and a partner get to decide amongst yourselves to each point to two boxes.&nbsp; 
When you have made your decision, the boxes are opened and their contents 
revealed.&nbsp; If one of the boxes your partner is pointing to contains the car 
and one of the boxes you are pointing to contains the key, then you will both win.&nbsp; 
What strategy maximizes the probability of winning, and what is the probability 
that you will win?</p>

<h2><a name="Handshakes at a dinner party"></a>Handshakes at a dinner party</h2>
<!-- added September 2011 -->
<p>[Pamela Zave shared this problem with me.]</p>
<p>Hilary and Jocelyn are throwing a dinner party at their house and have invited 
four other couples.&nbsp; After the guests arrive, people greet each other by 
shaking hands.&nbsp; As you would expect, a couple do not shake hands with each 
other and no two people shake each other's hands more than once.&nbsp; At some 
point during the handshaking process, Jocelyn gets up on a table and tells 
everyone to stop shaking hands.&nbsp; She also asks each person how many hands 
they have shaken and learns that no two people on the floor have shaken the same 
number of hands.&nbsp; How many hands has Hilary shaken?</p>

<h2><a name="Rectifying a pill mistake"></a>Rectifying a pill mistake</h2>
<!-- received January 2011, added 17 March 2011 -->
<p>[This is a slight rewording of a problem I got from Phil Wadler, who said he read the problem on 
<a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/irc/Puzzles">xkcd</a>.]</p>
<p>A man has a medical condition that requires him to take two kinds of pills, 
call them A and B.&nbsp; The man must take exactly one A pill and exactly one B pill 
each day, or he will die.&nbsp; The pills are taken by first dissolving them in 
water.</p>
<p>The man has a jar of A pills and a jar of B pills.&nbsp; One day, as he is about 
to take his pills, he takes out one A pill from the A jar and puts it in a glass 
of water.&nbsp; Then he accidentally takes out <em>two</em> B pills from the B jar and 
puts them in the water.&nbsp; Now, he is in the situation of having a glass of 
water with three dissolved pills, one A pill and two B pills.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
the pills are very expensive, so the thought of throwing out the water with the 
3 pills and starting over is out of the question.&nbsp; How should the man proceed in 
order to get the right quantity of A and B while not wasting any pills?</p>

<h2><a name="Chomp"></a>Chomp</h2>
<!-- received March 2010, added 2 December 2010 -->
<p>[Clark Barrett told me this problem.]</p>
<p>Given is a (possibly enormous) rectangular chocolate bar, divided into small squares
  in the usual way.  The chocolate holds a high quality standard, except for the square in the lower left-hand corner, which is poisonous.  Two players take turns eating
  from the chocolate in the following manner:  The player whose turn it is points to any
  one of the remaining squares, and then eats the selected square and all squares
  positioned above the selected square, to the right of the selected square, or both above
  and to the right of the selected square.  Note, although the board starts off rectangular,
  it may take on non-rectangular shapes during game play.  The object of the game is to
  avoid the poisonous square.  Assuming the initial chocolate bar is larger than 1x1, prove
  that the player who starts has a winning strategy.</p>
<p>Hint:  To my knowledge, no efficient strategy for winning the game is known.  That is,
  to decide on the best next move, a player may need to consider all possible continuations
  of the game.  Thus, you probably want to find a non-constructive proof.  That is, to prove
  that the player who starts has a winning strategy, prove just the existence of such a
  strategy; in particular, steer away from proofs that would construct a winning strategy for
  the initial player.

<h2><a name="Alternating T-shirt colors"></a>Alternating T-shirt colors</h2>
<!-- received summer 2010, added 2 December 2010 -->
<p>[I received this puzzle from Vladislav Shcherbina, but I changed gloves into T-shirts to emphasize
the people rather than the spaces between them.]</p>
<p>Ten friends walk into a room where each one of them receives a hat.&nbsp; On 
each hat is written a real number; no two hats have the same number.&nbsp; Each 
person can see the numbers written on his friends' hats, but cannot see his own.&nbsp; 
The friends then go into individual rooms where they are each given the choice 
between a white T-shirt and a black T-shirt.&nbsp; Wearing the respective T-shirts they 
selected, the friends gather again and are lined up in the order of their hat 
numbers.&nbsp; The desired property is that the T-shirts colors now alternate.</p>
<p>The friends are allowed to decide on a strategy before walking into the room 
with the hats, but they are not otherwise allowed to communicate with each other 
(except that they can see each other's hat numbers).&nbsp; Design a strategy that 
lets the friends always end up with alternating T-shirt colors.</p>

<h2><a name="Digit sums of multiples of 11"></a>Digit sums of multiples of 11</h2>
<!-- added February 2010 -->
<p>[I got this one from Madan Musuvathi.]</p>
<p>Some multiples of 11 have an even digit sum.&nbsp; For example, 7*11 = 77 and 
7+7 = 14, which is even; 11*11 = 121 and 1+2+1 = 4, which is even.&nbsp; Do all multiples of 11 have 
an even digit sum?&nbsp; (Prove that they do or find the smallest that does 
not.)</p>


<h2><a name="Weighing piles of coins"></a>Weighing piles of coins</h2>
<!-- added January 2010 -->
<p>[I got this puzzle from Dave Detlefs, who read it in an MIT Alumni magazine.&nbsp; 
This puzzle is a bit more involved than most puzzles on my page, so you may want 
a paper and pen (and some tenacity) for this one.&nbsp; Once you get into it, 
though, it's a hard puzzle to put aside until you've solved it.]</p>
<p>There are two kinds of coins, genuine and counterfeit.&nbsp; A genuine coin weighs 
X grams and a counterfeit coin weighs X+delta grams, where X is a positive 
integer and delta is a non-zero real number strictly between -5 and +5.&nbsp; You are 
presented with 13 piles of 4 coins each. &nbsp;All of the coins are genuine, except 
for one pile, in which all 4 coins are counterfeit.&nbsp; You are given a precise 
scale (say, a digital scale capable of displaying any real number).&nbsp; You are to 
determine three things: X, delta, and which pile contains the counterfeit 
coins.&nbsp; But you're only allowed to use the scale twice! </p>

<h2><a name="Guessing each other's coins"></a>Guessing each other's coins</h2>
<!-- added September 2009 -->
<p>[I got this puzzle from Raphael Reischuk, who also has a little
<a href="http://www.infsec.cs.uni-sb.de/~reischuk/riddles/">puzzle collection</a>.]</p>
<p>You and a friend each has a fair coin.&nbsp; You can decide on a 
strategy and then play the following game, without any further 
communication with each other.&nbsp; You flip your coin and then write 
down a guess as to what your friend's coin will say.&nbsp; Meanwhile, 
your friend flips her coin and writes down a guess as to what your 
coin says.&nbsp; There's a third person
involved:  The third person collects your guesses and inspects 
your coins.&nbsp; If both you and your friend correctly guessed each 
other's coins, then your team (you and your friend) receive 2 
Euros from the third person.&nbsp; But if either you or your friend (or
both) gets the guess wrong, then your team has to pay 1 Euro to the third person.&nbsp; This procedure is repeated all day.&nbsp; Assuming your object is to 
win money, are you happy to be on your team or would you rather trade 
places with the third person?

<h2><a name="The duck and the fox"></a>The duck and the fox</h2>
<!-- added March 2009 -->
<p>[I got this problem from Koen Claessen.]</p>
<p>A duck is in circular pond.&nbsp; The duck wants to swim ashore, because it 
wants to fly off and this particular duck is not able to start flying from the 
water.&nbsp; There is also a fox, on the shore.&nbsp; The fox wants to eat the 
duck, but this particular fox cannot swim, so it can only hope to catch the duck 
when the duck reaches the shore.&nbsp; The fox can run 4 times faster than the 
duck can swim.&nbsp; Is there always a way for the duck to escape?</p>

<h2><a name="Dropping eggs"></a>Dropping eggs</h2>
<!-- added January 2009 -->
<p>[I think I've heard some version of this problem before, but heard this one 
from Sophia Drossopoulou and Alex Summers.]</p>
<p>There's a certain kind of egg about which you wonder:&nbsp; What is the 
highest floor of a 36-story building from which you can drop an egg without it 
breaking?&nbsp; All eggs of this kind are identical, so you can conduct 
experiments.&nbsp; Unfortunately, you only have 2 eggs.&nbsp; Fortunately, if an 
egg survives a drop without breaking, it is as good as new--that is, you can 
then conduct another dropping experiment with it.&nbsp; What is the smallest 
number of drops that is sure to determine the answer to your wonderings?</p>

<h2><a name="Age of children"></a>Age of children</h2>
<!-- added January 2009 -->
<p>[I got this problem from the book <em>In code: a mathematical journey </em>by 
Sarah Flannery and David Flannery.]</p>
<p>A (presumed smart) insurance agent knocks on a door and a (presumed smart) 
woman opens.&nbsp; He introduces himself and asks if she has any children.&nbsp; 
She answers: 3.&nbsp; When he then asks their ages (which for this problem we 
abstract to integers), she hesitates.&nbsp; Then she decides to give him some 
information about their ages, saying &quot;the product of their ages is 36&quot;.&nbsp; He 
asks for more information and she gives in, saying &quot;the sum of their ages is 
equal to our neighbors' house number&quot;.&nbsp; The man jumps over the fence, 
inspects the house number, and the returns.&nbsp; &quot;You need to give me another 
hint&quot;, he begs.&nbsp; &quot;Alright&quot;, she says, &quot;my oldest child plays the piano&quot;.&nbsp; 
What are the ages of the children?</p>

<h2><a name="Capturing a pirate ship"></a>Capturing a pirate ship</h2>
<!-- added January 2009 -->
<p>[Howard Lederer sent me this problem.]</p>
<p>You're on a government ship, looking for a pirate ship.&nbsp; You know that 
the pirate ship travels at a constant speed, and you know what that speed is.&nbsp; 
Your ship can travel twice as fast as the pirate ship.&nbsp; Moreover, you know 
that the pirate ship travels along a straight line, but you don't know what that 
line is.&nbsp; It's very foggy, so foggy that you see nothing.&nbsp; But then!&nbsp; 
All of a sudden, and for just an instant, the fog clears enough to let you 
determine the exact position of the pirate ship.&nbsp; Then, the fog closes in 
again and you remain (forever) in the thick fog.&nbsp; Although you were able to 
determine the position of the pirate ship during that fog-free moment, you were 
not able to determine its direction.&nbsp; How will you navigate your government 
ship so that you will capture the pirate ship? </p>

<h2><a name="3-person duel"></a>3-person duel</h2>
<!-- added January 2009 -->
<p>[I got this problem from Johannes Kinder, who said he heard it from his 
brother.&nbsp; I reformulated the setting.]</p>
<p>A particular basketball shootout game consists of a number of duels.&nbsp; In 
each duel, one player is the challenger.&nbsp; The challenger chooses another 
player to challenge, and then gets one chance to shoot the hoop.&nbsp; If the 
player makes the shot, the playing being challenged is out.&nbsp; If the player 
does not make the shot, or 

if the player chooses to skip his turn, then the game continues with the next 
duel.&nbsp; A player wins when only that player remains.</p>
<p>One day, this game is played by three players: A, B, and C.&nbsp; Their skill 
levels vary considerably:&nbsp; player A makes every shot, player B has a 50% 
chance of making a shot, and player C has a 30% chance of making a shot.&nbsp; 
Because of the difference in skill levels, they decide to let C begin, then B, 
then A, and so on (skipping any player who is out of the game) until there is a 
winner.&nbsp; If everyone plays to win, what strategy should each player follow?</p>
<p>[For this follow-up question, it will be helpful to have a paper and pen--not 
because the calculations are hard, but because it helps in remembering the 
numbers.]</p>
<p>If A, B, and C follow their winning strategies (as determined above), which 
player has the highest chance of winning the game?</p>

<h2><a name="The genders of the neighboring family's children"></a>
  The genders of the neighboring family's children</h2>
<!-- added January 2009 -->
<p>[This problem was inspired by some basic probability questions mentioned in a 
lecture by Eric Hehner (and that can be formalized and solved by calculation 
using this <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hehner/ProPer.pdf">Probability 
Perspective</a>), and some subsequent discussions with him, Itay Neeman, Jim 
Woodcook, Ana Cavalcanti, and Leo Freitas.]</p>
<p>The house next door has some new neighbors.&nbsp; They have two children, but 
you don't know what mix of boys and girls they are.&nbsp; One day, your wife 
tells you &quot;At least one of the children is a girl&quot;.&nbsp; What is the 
probability that both are girls?</p>
<p>Your wife then tells you &quot;The way I found out that at least one of the 
children is a girl is that I saw one of the children playing outside, and it was 
a girl&quot;.&nbsp; Now, what is the probability that both are girls?</p>

<h2><a name="Finding a hermit"></a>Finding a hermit</h2>
<!-- added January 2009 -->
<p>[Claude Marché told me this puzzle.&nbsp; At first, it seems quite similar to 
&quot;Catching a spy&quot; (below), but the solution is entirely unrelated.]</p>
<p>There are five holes arranged in a line.&nbsp; A hermit hides in one of them.&nbsp; 
Each night, the hermit moves to a different hole, either the neighboring hole on 
the left or the neighboring hole on the right.&nbsp; Once a day, you get to

<h2><a name="Witches at a coffee shop"></a>Witches at a coffee shop</h2>
<p>[I got this puzzle from Alex Pintilie.]</p>
<p>Two witches each makes a nightly visit to an all-night coffee shop.&nbsp; 
Each arrives at a random time between 0:00 and 1:00.&nbsp; Each one of them 
stays for exactly 15 minutes.&nbsp; On any one given night, what is the probability that 
the witches will meet at the coffee shop?</p>

<h2><a name="Lemmings on a ledge"></a>Lemmings on a ledge</h2>
<p>[Vladislav Shcherbina told me this problem.]</p>
<p>A ledge is 1 meter long.&nbsp; On it are N lemmings.&nbsp; Each lemming 
travels along the ledge at a constant speed of 1 meter/minute.&nbsp; A lemming 
continues in the same direction until it either falls off the ledge or it 
collides with another lemming.&nbsp; If two lemmings collide, they both 
immediately change their directions.&nbsp; Initially, the lemmings have 
arbitrary starting positions and starting directions.&nbsp; What is the longest 
time that may elapse before all lemmings have fallen off the ledge?</p>
<p>[Michael Jackson suggested the following variation of the problem:&nbsp; 
Suppose the ledge is not horizontal, but is leaning.&nbsp; A lemming now travels 
up the ledge at a speed of 1 meter/minute and travels down the ledge at a speed 
of 2 meters/minute.&nbsp; What is the longest time before all lemmings have 
fallen off?]</p>

<h2><a name="Poisoned wine"></a>Poisoned wine</h2>
<p>[I got this problem from Vladislav Shcherbina.]</p>
<p>You have 240 barrels of wine, one of which has been poisoned.&nbsp; After 
drinking the poisoned wine, one dies within 24 hours.&nbsp; You have 5 slaves 
whom you are willing to sacrifice in order to determine which barrel contains 
the poisoned wine.&nbsp; How do you achieve this in 48 hours?</p>

<h2><a name="Dropping 9-terms from the harmonic series"></a>
 Dropping 9-terms from the harmonic series</h2>
<p>[Rajeev Joshi told me this problem.]</p>
<p>The harmonic series--that is, 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ...--diverges.&nbsp; 
That is, the sum is not finite.&nbsp; This is in difference to, for example, a 
geometric series--like
<span class="style1">½<sup>0</sup></span> +
<span class="style1">½<sup>1</sup></span> +
<span class="style1">½<sup>2</sup></span> +
<span class="style1">½<sup>3</sup></span> +
...--which converges, that is, has a finite sum.</p>
<p>Consider the harmonic series, but drop all terms whose denominator 
represented in decimal contains a 9.&nbsp; For example, you'd drop terms like 
1/9, 1/19, 1/90, 1/992, 1/529110.&nbsp; Does the resulting series converge or 
diverge?</p>
<p>[More generally, you may consider representing the denominator in the base of 
your choice and dropping terms that contain a certain digit of your choice.]</p>
<p>[Here is a follow-up question suggested by Gary Leavens.]</p>
<p>Consider again the harmonic series, but drop a term only if the denominator 
represented in decimal contains two consecutive 9's.&nbsp; For example, you'd 
drop 1/99, 1/992, 1/299, but not 1/9 or 1/909.&nbsp; Does this series converge 
or diverge?</p>


<h2><a name="Finding a restaurant in a park"></a>
 Finding a restaurant in a park</h2>
<!-- updated Sep 2011 -->
<p>[Michael Jackson told me this problem, as a variation of a problem he got 
from Koen Claessen.]</p>
<p>A park contains paths that intersect at various places.&nbsp; The 
intersections all have the properties that they are 3-way intersections and that, 
with one exception, 
they are indistinguishable from each other.&nbsp; The one exception is an intersection 
where there is a restaurant.&nbsp; The restaurant is reachable from everywhere 
in the park.&nbsp; Your task is to find your way to the restaurant.</p>
<p>The 
park has strict littering regulations, so you are not allowed to modify the 
paths or intersections (for example, you are not allowed to leave a note an 
intersection saying you have been there).&nbsp; However, you are allowed to do 
some bookkeeping on a pad of paper that you bring with you at all times (in the 
computer-science parlance, you are allowed some state).&nbsp; How can you find the restaurant?</p>
<p>You may assume that once you enter an intersection, you can continue to the 
left, continue to the right, or return to where you just came from.</p>
<p>[As an 
alternative puzzle, suppose you must continue through an intersection, turning 
either left or right, but not turning around to exit the intersection the way 
you just entered it.]</p>

<h2><a name="Opening boxes in a prison courtyard"></a>Opening boxes in a prison courtyard</h2>
<p>[I got this problem from Clark Barrett, who got it from Robert Nieuwenhuis.&nbsp; Just when you thought you had 
heard all variations of prisoners and boxes...]</p>
<p>100 prisoners agree on a strategy before playing the following game:&nbsp; 
One at a time (in some unspecified order), each of the prisoners is taken to a 
courtyard where there is a line of 100 boxes.&nbsp; The prisoner gets to make 
choices to open 50 of the boxes.&nbsp; When a box is opened, it reveals the name 
of a prisoner (the prisoners have distinct names).&nbsp; The names written in 
the boxes are in 1-to-1 correspondence with the prisoners; that is, each name is 
found in exactly one box.&nbsp; If after opening 50 boxes, the prisoner has <em>
not</em> found his own name, the game is over and all the prisoners lose.&nbsp; 
But if the prisoner <em>does</em> find the box that contains his name among the 
50 boxes he opens, then the prisoner is taken to the other side of the courtyard 
where he cannot communicate with the others, the boxes are once again closed, 
and the next prisoner is brought out into the courtyard.&nbsp; If all prisoners 
make it to the other side of the courtyard, they win.</p>
<p>One possible strategy is for each prisoner to randomly select 50 boxes and 
open them.&nbsp; This gives the prisoners 1 chance out of 2</font><sup><span class="style1">100</span></sup><font face='verdana, arial, geneva, sans-serif'> 
to win--a slim chance, indeed.&nbsp; But the prisoners can do better, using a 
strategy that for a random configuration of the boxes will give them a larger 
chance of winning.&nbsp; How good a strategy can you develop?

<h2><a name="Frugal selection of weights to determine the weight of a thing"></a>
 Frugal selection of weights to weigh a thing</h2>
<p>[Matthew Parkinson told me this problem, or a slight variation thereof.]</p>
<p>You are given a balance (that is, a weighing machine with two trays) and a 
positive integer N.&nbsp; You are then to request a number of weights.&nbsp; You 
pick which denominations of weights you want and how many of each you want.&nbsp; 
After you receive the weights you requested, you are given a <em>thing</em> 
whose weight is an integer between 1 and N, inclusive.&nbsp; Using the balance 
and the weights you requested, you must now determine the exact weight of the
<em>thing</em>.</p>
<p>As a function of N, how few weights can you get by requesting?</p>

<h2><a name="Initializing an array in constant time"></a>Initializing an array in constant time</h2>
<p>[Unlike most problems on this page, this problem requires some computer 
science knowledge.&nbsp; Many years ago, I read a solution to this problem in 
one of Donald Knuth's books (I think).&nbsp; The algorithm intrigued me and 
stuck in my mind.]</p>
<p>Consider the following array operations.&nbsp; Init(N,d) initializes an array 
of N elements so that each element has value d.&nbsp; Once Init has been called, 
the following two operations can be applied:&nbsp; For any i such that 0 &lt;= i &lt; 
N, Get(i) returns the array element at position i and Set(i,v) sets the array 
element at position i to the value v.</p>
<p>Given any amount of memory you want, implement the three operations so that 
each operation has an O(1) time complexity.</p>

<h2><a name="Translation error in a cookbook"></a>Translation error in a cookbook</h2>
<p>[This problem is a bit fuzzier than most on this page, just because I don't 
know for sure that the cookbook publisher made a translation error.&nbsp; But I 
hope you'll still enjoy the problem.]</p>
<p>Recently, I received a wonderful cookbook.&nbsp; In an appendix, it shows a 
table that converts oven temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.&nbsp; 
(Side remark: Approximate oven temperatures are actually really simple to 
convert in your head--just double the number of degrees Celsius to get the 
number of degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp; For oven temperatures, this will be within 
10 F of the exact answer.)</p>
<p>The table has a footnote that says &quot;If your oven has a fan, reduce the recipe 
temperature by 68 F&quot;.&nbsp; I have a strong hunch that this footnote suffers 
from a translation error.&nbsp; How many degrees Fahrenheit should it have said 
to reduce the temperature by?&nbsp; (No knowledge of convection ovens required.)</p>

<h2><a name="Making a square larger"></a>Making a square larger</h2>
<p>[I got this problem from Radu Grigore.]</p>
<p>You are given four points (on a Euclidian plane) that make up the corners of 
a square.&nbsp; You may change the positions of the points by a sequence of 
moves.&nbsp; Each move changes the position of one point, say p, to a new 
location, say p', by &quot;skipping over&quot; one of the other 3 points.&nbsp; More 
precisely, p <em>skips over </em>a point q if it is moved to the diametrically 
opposed side of q.&nbsp; In other words, a move from p to p' is allowed if there 
exists a point q such that q = (p + p') / 2.</p>
<p>Find a sequence of moves that results in a larger square.&nbsp; Or, if no 
such sequence is possible, give a proof of why it isn't possible.&nbsp; (The new 
square need not be oriented the same way as the original square.&nbsp; For 
example, the larger square may be turned 45 degrees from the original, and the 
larger square may have the points in a different order from in the original 
square.)&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a name="Catching a spy"></a>Catching a spy</h2>
<p>[I got this problem from Radu Grigore.]</p>
<p>A spy is located on a one-dimensional line.&nbsp; At time 0, the spy is at 
location A.&nbsp; With each time interval, the spy moves B units to the right 
(if B is negative, the spy is moving left).&nbsp; A and B are fixed integers, 
but they are unknown to you.&nbsp; You are to catch the spy.&nbsp; The means by 
which you can attempt to do that is:&nbsp; at each time interval (starting at 
time 0), you can choose a location on the line and ask whether or not the spy is 
currently at that location.&nbsp; That is, you will ask a question like &quot;<em>Is 
the spy currently at location 27?</em>&quot; and you will get a yes/no answer.&nbsp; 
Devise an algorithm that will eventually find the spy.&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a name="Average clan size"></a>Average clan size</h2>
<p>[I got this problem from Ernie Cohen, who I think had made it up.&nbsp; Itay 
Neeman suggested the use of &quot;clans&quot; instead of Ernie's original &quot;families&quot;, 
because &quot;clans&quot; has a stronger connotation of the groups being disjoint.]</p>
<p>The people in a country are partitioned into clans.&nbsp; In order to

<p>
Consider a game that you play against an opponent.&nbsp; In front of you are an 
even number of coins of possibly different denominations.&nbsp; The coins are 
arranged in a line.&nbsp; You and your opponent take turns selecting coins.&nbsp; 
Each player takes one coin per turn and must take it from an end of the line, 
that is, the current leftmost coin or the current rightmost coin.&nbsp; When all 
coins have been removed, add the value of the coins collected by each player.&nbsp; 
It is possible that you and your opponent end up with the same value (for 
example, if all coins have the same denomination).&nbsp; Develop a strategy 
where you take the first turn and where your final value is at least that of 
your opponent (that is, don't let your opponent end up with coins worth more 
than your coins).</p>

<p>
N people team up and decide on a strategy for playing this game.&nbsp; Then they 
walk into a room.&nbsp; On entry to the room, each person is given a hat on 
which one of the first N natural numbers is written.&nbsp; There may be 
duplicate hat numbers.&nbsp; For example, for N=3, the 3 team members may get 
hats labeled 2, 0, 2.&nbsp; Each person can see the numbers written on the 
others' hats, but does not know the number written on his own hat.&nbsp; Every 
person then simultaneously guesses the number of his own hat.&nbsp; What 
strategy can the team follow to make sure that at least one person on the team 
guesses his hat number correctly?</p>

<h2><a name="Voting on how to distribute coins"></a>Voting on how to distribute coins</h2>

[This problem was communicated to me by Sophia Drossopoulou.]<p>100 coins are to 
be distributed among some number of persons, referred to by the labels A, B, C, 
D, ....&nbsp; The distribution works as follows.&nbsp; The person with the 
alphabetically highest label (for example, among 5 people, E) is called the <i>
chief</i>.&nbsp; The chief gets to propose a distribution of the coins among the 
persons (for example, chief E may propose that everyone get 20 coins, or he may 
propose that he get 100 coins and the others get 0 coins).&nbsp; Everyone 
(including the chief) gets to vote yes/no on the proposed distribution.&nbsp; If 
the majority vote is yes, then that’s the final distribution.&nbsp; If there’s a 
tie (which there could be if the number of persons is even), then the chief gets 
to break the tie.&nbsp; If the majority vote is no, then the chief gets 0 coins 
and has to leave the game, the person with the alphabetically next-highest name 
becomes the new chief, and the process to distribute the 100 coins is repeated 
among the persons that remain.&nbsp; Suppose there are 5 persons and that every 
person wants to maximize the number of coins that are distributed to them.&nbsp; 
Then, what distribution should chief E propose?</p>
<p>[This problem and its solution caused my niece Sarah Brown to send me the

[I got this problem from Joe Morris, who created it.]<p>Each of two players 
picks a different sequence of two coin tosses.&nbsp; That is, each player gets 
to pick among HH, HT, TH, and TT.&nbsp; Then, a coin is flipped repeatedly and 
the first player to see his sequence appear wins.&nbsp; For example, if one 
player picks HH, the other picks TT, and the coin produces a sequence that 
starts H, T, H, T, T, then the player who picked TT wins.&nbsp; The coin is 
biased, with H having a 2/3 probability and T having a 1/3 probability.&nbsp; If 
you played this game, would you want to pick your sequence first or second? </p>

only the winner of each game moves up the tree (ignoring the initial games, 
where the teams are placed into groups of 4, 2 of which of which go onto play in

<p>A game is played as follows. N people are sitting around a table, each with 
one penny.&nbsp; One person begins the game, takes one of his pennies (at this 
time, he happens to have exactly one penny) and passes it to the person to his

<p>[A follow-up question.]</p>
<p>There's a simple technique 
that, given any odd positive integer, allows you to figure out the other two 
integer sides of a right triangle in your head (or with pen and paper if the 
numbers get too large).&nbsp; Find this technique.</p>

contents stolen, and the box never delivered.&nbsp; <i>Except</i>: if the box is 
locked, then the postal service won't bother trying to open it (since there are 
so many other boxes whose contents are so much easier to steal) and the box is 
delivered unharmed.</p>
<p>Boris and Natasha each has a large supply of boxes of different sizes, each 
capable of being locked by padlocks.&nbsp; Also, Boris and Natasha each has a 
large supply of padlocks with matching keys.&nbsp; The padlocks have unique 
keys.&nbsp; Finally, Boris has a ring that he would like to send to Natasha.&nbsp; 
How can Boris send the ring to Natasha so that she can wear it (without either 
of them destroying any locks or boxes)?</p>
<h2><a name="Burning ropes to measure time"></a>Burning ropes to measure time</h2>
<p>[I first got this problem from Ernie Cohen.&nbsp; Apparently, it has appeared 
as a <a href="http://cartalk.cars.com/content/puzzler/">Car Talk 
Puzzler</a>, but I've been unable to find it on their web site.]</p>
<p>Warm-up:&nbsp; You are given a box of matches and a piece of rope.&nbsp; The 
rope burns at the rate of one rope per hour, but it may not burn uniformly.&nbsp; 
For example, if you light the rope at one end, it will take exactly 60 minutes 
before the entire rope has burnt up, but it may be that the first 1/10 of the 
rope takes 50 minutes to burn and that the remaining 9/10 of the rope takes only 
10 minutes to burn.&nbsp; How can you measure a period of exactly 30 minutes?&nbsp; 
You can choose the starting time.&nbsp; More precisely, given the matches and 
the rope, you are to say the words &quot;start&quot; and &quot;done&quot; exactly 30 minutes apart.</p>
<p>The actual problem:&nbsp; Given a box of matches and two such ropes, not 
necessarily identical, measure a period of 15 minutes.</p>
<h2><a name="Flipping cards"></a>Flipping cards</h2>
<p>[I have heard several versions of this problem.&nbsp; I first heard it from 
Bertrand Meyer, who got the problem from Yuri Gurevich.]</p>
<p>You're given a regular deck of 52 playing cards.&nbsp; In the pile you're 
given, 13 cards face up and the rest face down.&nbsp; You are to separate the 
given cards into two piles, such that the number of face-up cards in each pile 
is the same.&nbsp; In separating the cards, you're allowed to flip cards over.&nbsp; 
The catch:&nbsp; you have to do this in a dark room where you cannot determine 
whether a card is face up or face down.</p>
<h2><a name="Three hat colors"></a>Three hat colors</h2>
<p>[I think I got this puzzle from Lyle Ramshaw, who I think got it from some 
collection of problems or maybe the American Mathematical Monthly.]</p>
<p>A team of three people decide on a strategy for playing the following game.&nbsp; 
Each player walks into a room.&nbsp; On the way in, a fair coin is tossed for 
each player, deciding that player's hat color, either red or blue.&nbsp; Each 
player can see the hat colors of the other two players, but cannot see her own 
hat color.&nbsp; After inspecting each other's hat colors, each player decides 
on a response, one of: &quot;I have a red hat&quot;, &quot;I had a blue hat&quot;, or &quot;I pass&quot;.&nbsp; 
The responses are recorded, but the responses are not shared until every player 
has recorded her response.&nbsp; The team <i>wins</i> if at least one player 
responds with a color and every color response correctly describes the hat color 
of the player making the response.&nbsp; In other words, the team <i>loses</i> 
if either everyone responds with &quot;I pass&quot; or someone responds with a color that 
is different from her hat color.</p>
<p>What strategy should one use to maximize the team's expected chance of 
winning?</p>
<p>For example, one possible strategy is to single out one of the three players.&nbsp; 
This player will respond &quot;I have a red hat&quot; and the others will respond &quot;I 
pass&quot;.&nbsp; The expected chance of winning with this strategy is 50%.&nbsp; Can 
you do better?&nbsp; Provide a better strategy or prove that no better strategy 
exists.</p>
<p>[Here's a related problem, which I got from Jim Saxe.]</p>
<p>In this variation, the responses are different.&nbsp; Instead of &quot;red&quot;, 
&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;, a response is now an integer, indicating a bet on having the hat 
color red.&nbsp; Once the responses have been collected, the team's <i>score</i> 
is calculated as follows:&nbsp; Add the integer responses for those players 
wearing red hats, and subtract from that the integers of those players wearing 
blue hats.&nbsp; For example, if the three players respond with 12, -2, -100 
while wearing blue, red, blue, respectively, then the team's score is (-2) - 
(12) - (-100) = 90.&nbsp; The team wins if and only if its score is strictly 
positive.</p>
<p>For example, any strategy used in the first game can be used with this second 
game by replacing &quot;I have a red hat&quot; with 1, &quot;I have a blue hat&quot; with -1, and &quot;I 
pass with 0&quot;.&nbsp; Such a strategy wins anytime the strategy would have 
produced a win in the first game; plus, this strategy may win in some cases 
where the strategy would not produce a win in the first game.&nbsp; For example, 
for hat colors red, red, red, the strategy &quot;red&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot; loses in the 
first game, whereas 1, 1, -1 still wins in the second game.&nbsp; Hence, playing 
this second game can only increase the team's expected chance of winning.</p>
<p>[Further generalizations.]</p>
<p>Of course, you can generalize these two problems from 3 players to N players.&nbsp; 
The solution to the first problem with N players may require more mathematical 
sophistication than the solution to the second problem with N players.</p>
<h2><a name="The line of persons with hats"></a>The line of persons with hats</h2>
<p>[Ernie Cohen told me this problem.]</p>
<p>100 persons are standing in line, each facing the same way.&nbsp; Each person 
is wearing a hat, either red or blue, but the hat color is not known to the 
person wearing the hat.&nbsp; In fact, a person knows the hat color only of 
those persons standing ahead of him in line.</p>
<p>Starting from the back of the line (that is, with the person who can see the 
hat colors of all of other 99 persons), in order, and ending with the person at 
the head of the line (that is, with the person who can see the hat color of no 
one), each person exclaims either &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot;.&nbsp; These exclamations can 
be heard by all.&nbsp; Once everyone has spoken, a <i>score</i> is calculated, 
equal to the number of persons whose exclamation accurately describes their own 
hat color.</p>
<p>What strategy should the 100 persons use in order to get as high a score as 
possible, regardless of how the hat colors are assigned?&nbsp; (That is, what 
strategy achieves the best worst-case score?)</p>
<p>For example, if everyone exclaims &quot;red&quot;, the worst-case score is 0.&nbsp; If 
the first 99 persons exclaim the color of the hat of the person at the head of 
the line and the person at the head of the line then exclaims the color he has 
heard, the worst-case score is 1.&nbsp; If every other person exclaims the hat 
color of the person immediate in front and that person then repeats the color he 
has just heard, then the worst-case score is 50.&nbsp; Can you do better?</p>
<p>[Here's a generalization of the problem.]</p>
<p>Instead of using just red and blue as the possible hat colors and 
exclamations, use N different colors.</p>
<h2><a name="The prisoners and the switch"></a>The prisoners and the switch</h2>
<p>[Tom Ball told me (a close variation of) this problem.&nbsp; The problem has 
been featured as a <a href="http://cartalk.cars.com/content/puzzler/">Car Talk 
Puzzler</a> under the name
<a href="http://cartalk.cars.com/content/puzzler/transcripts/200307/answer.html">Prison Switcharoo</a> (beware: the Car Talk problem page also contains an 
answer).]</p>
<p>N prisoners get together to decide on a strategy.&nbsp; Then, each prisoner 
is taken to his own isolated cell.&nbsp; A prison guard goes to a cell and takes 
its prisoner to a room where there is a switch.&nbsp; The switch can either be 
up or down.&nbsp; The prisoner is allowed to inspect the state of the switch and 
then has the option of flicking the switch.&nbsp; The prisoner is then taken 
back to his cell.&nbsp; The prison guard repeats this process infinitely often, 
each time choosing fairly among the prisoners.&nbsp; That is, the prison guard 
will choose each prisoner infinitely often.</p>
<p>At any time, any prisoner can exclaim &quot;Now, every prisoner has been in the 
room with the switch&quot;.&nbsp; If, at that time, the statement is correct, all 
prisoners are set free; if the statement is not correct, all prisoners are 
immediately executed.&nbsp; What strategy should the prisoners use to ensure 
their eventual freedom?</p>
<p>(Just in case there's any confusion:&nbsp; The initial state of the switch is 
unknown to the prisoners.&nbsp; The state of the switch is changed only by the 
prisoners.)</p>
<p>As a warm-up, you may consider the same problem but with a known initial 
state of the switch.</p>
<h2><a name="Table with four coins"></a>Table with four coins</h2>
<p>[This problem has crossed the desk of Jan van de Snepscheut, but it may have 
been due to someone else.]</p>
<p>A square table has a coin at each corner.&nbsp; Design an execution sequence, 
each of whose steps consists of one of the following operations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ONE:&nbsp; The operation chooses a coin (possibly a different one with 
	each execution of the operation) and flips it. </li>
	<li>SIDE:&nbsp; The operation chooses a side of the table and flips the two 
	coins along that side.</li>
	<li>DIAG:&nbsp; The operation chooses a diagonal of the table and flips the 
	two coins along that diagonal.</li>
</ul>
<p>such that at some point during the execution (not necessarily at the end), a 
state where all coins are turned the same way (all heads or all tails) obtains.</p>
<h2><a name="Stabilizing nodes from an anchor"></a>Stabilizing nodes from an anchor</h2>
<p>[I got this problem from Jay Misra, who had received it from Edsger Dijkstra.&nbsp; This particular description of the 
problem borrows from a description given by Michael Jackson.] </p>
<p>In a finite, undirected, connected graph, an integer variable v(<i>n</i>) is 
associated with each node <i>n</i>.&nbsp; One node is distinguished as the <i>
anchor</i>.&nbsp; An operation OP(<i>n</i>) is defined on nodes:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>OP(<i>n</i>):<br>
&nbsp; if node <i>n</i> is the anchor, then do nothing,<br>
&nbsp; else set v(<i>n</i>) to the value 1 + min{v(<i>m</i>)}, where <i>m</i> 
	ranges over all neighbors of <i>n</i> that are distinct from <i>n</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An infinite sequence of operations &lt;OP(<i>n</i>),OP(<i>m</i>), ...&gt; is 
executed, the node arguments <i>n</i>, <i>m</i>, ... for the operations being 
chosen arbitrarily and not necessarily fairly.&nbsp; Show that eventually all v(<i>n</i>) 
stabilize.&nbsp; That is, that after some finite prefix of the infinite sequence 
of operations, no further operation changes v(<i>n</i>) for any node <i>n</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="Points on a circle"></a>Points on a circle</h2>
<p>[This problem was told to me by Dave Detlefs, who got it from the following 
impressive <a href="http://www.wizardofodds.com/math/">collection of math problems</a>.]</p>
<p>Given <i>N</i> points randomly distributed around the circumference of a 
circle, what is the probability that all <i>N</i> points lie on the same 
semi-circle?</p>
<h2><a name="The electrician problem"></a>The electrician problem</h2>
<p>[I learned about this problem from Greg Nelson, who phrased the problem in 
terms of a tall building and elevator rides.&nbsp; Here, I instead say a 
mountain and helicopter rides, which is the way Lyle Ramshaw had heard the 
problem and which more forcefully emphasizes the price of each ride.&nbsp; As a 
computer scientist, I like this problem a lot, because of the variety of 
solutions of different computational complexities.]</p>
<p>You're an electrician working at a mountain.&nbsp; There are <i>N</i> wires 
running from one side of the mountain to the other.&nbsp; The problem is that 
the wires are not labeled, so you just see <i>N</i> wire ends on each side of 
the mountain.&nbsp; Your job is to match these ends (say, by labeling the two 
ends of each<br>
wire in the same way).<br>
<br>
In order to figure out the matching, you can twist together wire ends, thus 
electrically connecting the wires.&nbsp; You can twist as many wire ends as you 
want, into as many clusters as you want, at the side of the mountain where you 
happen to be at the time.&nbsp; You can also untwist the wire ends at the side 
of the mountain where you're at.&nbsp; You are equipped with an Ohm meter, which 
lets you test the connectivity of any pair of wires.&nbsp; (Actually, it's an 
abstract Ohm meter, in that it only tells you whether or not two things are 
connected, not the exact resistance.)<br>
<br>
You are not charged [no pun intended] for twisting, untwisting, and using the 
Ohm meter.&nbsp; You are only charged for each helicopter ride you make from one 
side of the mountain to the other.&nbsp; What is the best way to match the 
wires?&nbsp; (Oh, <i>N</i>&gt;2, for there is no solution when <i>N</i>=2.)

<h2><a name="The hidden card"></a>The hidden card</h2>
<p>[I learned about this problem from Lyle Ramshaw.&nbsp; See also puzzles 19 
and 20 on the following large collection of
<a href="http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/">mathematical puzzles</a>.]</p>
<p>In this problem, you and a partner are to come up with a scheme for 
communicating the value of a hidden card.&nbsp; The game is played as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your partner is sent out of the room.</li>
<li>A dealer hands you 5 cards from a standard 52 card deck.</li>
<li>You look at the cards, and hand them back to the dealer, one by one, in 
	whatever order you choose.</li>
<li>The dealer takes the first card that you hand her and places it, face up, in 
    a spot labeled &quot;0&quot;'.&nbsp; The next three cards that you hand her, she
    places, similarly, in spots labeled &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;.&nbsp;
    The last card that you hand her goes, face down, in a spot labeled &quot;hidden&quot;.&nbsp;
    (While you control the order of the cards, you have no control over their orientations,
    sitting in their spots; so you can't use orientation to transmit information to your 
    partner.)</li>
<li>Your partner enters the room, looks at the four face-up cards and the 
	spots in which they lie and, from that information (and your 
	previously-agreed-upon game plan), determines the suit and value of the 
	hidden card.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question: What is the foolproof scheme that you and your partner settled on ahead of time?</p>
<p>As a follow-up question, consider the same problem but with a 124-card deck.</p>
<h2><a name="Knight, knave, commoner"></a>Knight, knave, commoner</h2>
<p>[Communicated to me by Carroll Morgan.]</p>
<p>A king has a daughter and wants to choose the man she will marry.&nbsp; There 
are three suitors from whom to choose, a Knight, a Knave, and a Commoner.&nbsp; 
The king wants to avoid choosing the Commoner as the bridegroom, but he does not 
know which man is which.&nbsp; All the king knows is that the Knight always 
speaks the truth, the Knave always lies, and the Commoner can do either.&nbsp; 
The king will ask each man one yes/no question, and will then choose who gets to 
marry the princess.&nbsp; What question should the king ask and how should he 
choose the bridegroom?</p>
<p>[A follow-up question posed by Lyle Ramshaw.]</p>
<p>Suppose the three suitors know each other (an assumption that's not needed in 
the original problem).&nbsp; Then find a new strategy for the king where the 
king only needs to ask a question of any two of the three suitors in order to 
pick the bridegroom.</p>
<p>[Another variation of the problem.]</p>
<p>Find a strategy for the king where the king can ask questions of only one 
suitor, but can ask two questions of that suitor.</p>
<p>
[And another (at first sight incredible) follow-up question communicated to 
me by both Jim Saxe and Pierre Nallet.]</p>
<p>Find a strategy for the king where the king can ask only one yes/no question 
and only of one suitor.</p>
